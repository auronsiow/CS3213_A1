Welcome to Key Word In Context (KWIC) Program.
KWIC is a java program that formats a list of sentences into concordance sentences.
Each sentence is circularly generated by taking the 1st word of the sentence and placing it at the end.
The program will list all the concordance sentences, excluding the illegal words found in the first word of each sentence

For example, if the sentences are: "hello world" and "The Invisible Man" and the illegals words are "this is the man" then the output shall be:
   Invisible Man The
   Hello world
   World hello

To Begin
